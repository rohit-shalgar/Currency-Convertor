Retry and fallback mechanism:

    - if a method throws exception on a failure, automatically @Retry will be triggered and fallback
        method will be called.

Circuit Breaker-
    - closed, open ,half open
    - if failures are above threshhold, circuit breaker opens and calls the fallback method
    - after a delay it goes into half open state and check if the requests are still failing

Number of retries, fallback method, backoff time, exponential backoffs are all configurable in application.properties

Rate limiter and bulk head:
    - you can limit number of calls in a particular period and number of concurrent calls to the API
